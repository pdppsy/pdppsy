- 👋 Hi, I'm Denis.
- 👀 I'm interested in learning Java language.
- 🌱 I'm currently learning at University in the first year.
- 💞️ I am looking for cooperation with those who are starting and with
 those who are ready to become a kind teacher who can help me
 confidently go down the difficult but exciting path of programming
 and become one of those who contribute to the development of 
 software products.

- 📫 How to reach me ...
